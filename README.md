# Awesome talks

Same idea as the [Awesome talks](https://github.com/JanVanRyswyck/awesome-talks) list, but curated according to my interests.

My interests are:
* Systems code: compilers, databases, operating systems (stuff likely to be written in C/C++ or similar)
* Programming languages
* Security and Reliability
* Engineering practices

##### Management

* [Building Software Capital: How to write the highest quality code and why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta3S8CRN2TM) by **David Sankel** [59:38]
  * The [0:00 to 13:30] period is recommended for talking about technical debt and software capital from a business perspective. The rest of the talk is covered better elsewhere.
