# Awesome talks

Same idea as the [Awesome talks](https://github.com/JanVanRyswyck/awesome-talks) list, but curated according to my interests.

My interests are:
* Systems code: compilers, databases, operating systems (stuff likely to be written in C/C++ or similar)
* Programming languages
* Security and Reliability
* Engineering practices

In addition to being intresting, the content should be worth knowing, and well presented to be awesome enough for this list.

##### Management

* [Building Software Capital: How to write the highest quality code and why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta3S8CRN2TM) by **David Sankel** [59:38] CppCon2016
  * The [0:00 to 13:30] period is recommended for talking about technical debt and software capital from a business perspective. The rest of the talk is covered better elsewhere.

#### C and C++

* [Efficiency with Algorithms, Performance with Data Structures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHNmRkzxHWs) by **Chandler Carruth** [1:13:40] CppCon2014
* [High Performance Code 201: Hybrid Data Structures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vElZc6zSIXM) by **Chandler Carruth** [55:48] CppCon2016
* [Leak-Freedom in C++... By Default](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfmTagWcqoE) by **Herb Sutter** [1:39:24] CppCon2016
* [Refactor or die](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzmjXK9JZ9o) by **Mikhail Matrosov** [4:58] CppCon2017

#### Security

* [Security, Mooreâ€™s Law, And The Anomaly Of Cheap Complexity](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17bKudNDduvN-7hWv7S84MiHUj2AnOPNbwjTM8euDC8w/edit#slide=id.p1v) by **Thomas Dullien** [44:52] CyCon2018 [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17bKudNDduvN-7hWv7S84MiHUj2AnOPNbwjTM8euDC8w/edit#slide=id.p1v)
